## WTF does that mean?


How Wownero can help you?

Wownero will create 2 versions of an apple.

1. Ethereum Apple 1 will have a value of 1 ether.

2. Bitcoin Apple will have a value of 2 bitcoins.

Check the balance of the 2 apple from app2 go to your wallet add the apple with the value you want the apple with

"Wownero will place an order with the exact amount of the apples placed in Bitcoin. This will give you the coins instantly".

Wownero is already in talks with several other exchanges on exchanges like Poloniex, but I am unable to reveal their identities at this stage.
